# algo_mass_data
Repository containing the project for the AlgoMassData module of the master's degree in Data Science @ UniMI for the accademic year 2023/24.

## Topic - Image Classification (P4)

> <p align="justify"> An event is a specific occurrence of something that happens in a certain time and a certain place involving one or more participants, which can frequently be described as a change of state. The goal of event detection is to identify event instance(s) in data and, if existing, identify the event type as well as all of its participants and attributes. The goal of the project is to correctly classify test images: the model should be able to discern between soccer-related events and general images, and also classify the specific event occurring.</p>

The repository contains:
- report.pdf: a brief description of the implemented methodology, the elaboration of the data and the obtained results.
- proj_by_author.ipynb: Colab notebook that executes the script considering classes of images based on the authors. The code is found also in Google Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PZKN767Q3umykUFHULIHRwboT60ygZxZ#scrollTo=v1JandxxafPs)
- proj_by_support.ipynb: Colab notebook that executes the script considering classes of images based on the support. The code is found also in Google Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zV1bFAUw--8TBnguqF0hxSW7DIlVNSfQ)
