# algo_mass_data
Repository containing the project for the AlgoMassData module of the master's degree in Data Science @ UniMI for the accademic year 2023/24.

## Topic - Image Classification (P4)

> <p align="justify"> Using the "Prado Museum Pictures" dataset of Project 3, the task is to implement a deep-learning-based system classifying pictures according to any reasonable organization of classes (e.g., by authorâ€“selecting a manageable subset of authors, or by support). Note that the dataset does not directly contain the picture images, but these can be downloaded separately using the `work_image_url` attribute of the `prado.csv` file. </p>

### Instruction

The repository contains:
- report.pdf: a brief description of the implemented methodology, the elaboration of the data and the obtained results.
- proj_by_author.ipynb: Colab notebook that executes the script considering classes of images based on the authors. The code is found also in Google Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PZKN767Q3umykUFHULIHRwboT60ygZxZ#scrollTo=iw0NAEtvUAT6)
- proj_by_support.ipynb: Colab notebook that executes the script considering classes of images based on the support. The code is found also in Google Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zV1bFAUw--8TBnguqF0hxSW7DIlVNSfQ#scrollTo=iw0NAEtvUAT6)
